I have been in Tech lead/Architect positions for various years now while switching to hands-on individual contributor roles in-between. 
I began my career as a software developer on windows platform and have written numerous client and server applications using C++, C# etc for industrial, financial, networking domain applications.
I have architected and developed database applications and have experience with data mining. 
I have experience designing REST interfaces for clients across multiple platforms.

Lately I have developed interest in Apple iOS technologies and would like to develop some ground breaking apps that will provide simple solutions to difficult problems.



I focus on delivering highest quality product while keeping the teamâ€™s strategy aligned with customer priorities and business vision. I encourage team to deliver high quality products even under tight schedules. 

I love learning new technologies and taking up hard challenges. So if you are looking for a candidate that is skilled and motivates the team to deliver high quality products please consider my application.
