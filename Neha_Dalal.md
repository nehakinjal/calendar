Hello Outlook team,

Here is a little about myself.

I began my career as a software developer on Microsoft Windows platform and have developed numerous client and server applications using C++, C# etc for industrial, financial and networking domain applications.  

I have architected and developed database applications and have experience with data mining. 

I have experience designing REST interfaces for clients across multiple platforms.

Lately I have developed interest in Apple iOS technologies and would like to develop some ground breaking apps that will provide simple solutions to difficult problems. I have experience architecting and developing iOS solutions from ground-up, including backend database design and service REST interface definition.  

While I enjoy iOS development currently, my next goal is to learn Machine learning and Database analytics. I also would like to better use my experience by taking up a leadership position.

I focus on delivering highest quality product while keeping the teamâ€™s strategy aligned with customer priorities and business vision. I encourage team to deliver high quality products even under tight schedules. 

I love learning new technologies and taking up hard challenges. I am a strong developer, encourage code reuse and community learning to promote productivity. So if you are looking for a candidate that is skilled and motivates the team to deliver high quality products please consider my application.
