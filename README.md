# Calendar
Calendar Lite app has following features

##Features:
1. Shows calendar for the whole year. 
2. Shows events for selected day in calendar
3. Shows Calendar only view
4. Shows Agenda only view
5. When you scroll through events it scrolls through calendar to select the correct date
6. If you select a day with no events in calendar it shows "No events" in agenda
7. When viewing Calendar if you select a day it brings up agenda for that day.
8. Events can be added using Events.json file or programatically.

##Note:
1. For simplicity the app shows only current year. The app can easily be extended to show previous and future years.
2. I have not implemented + button to define new calendar events due to limitation of time. This can be done very easily by adding date picker form
